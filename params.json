{"name":"RainbowBS","tagline":"RainbowSys Base Component","body":"### Welcome to RainbowBS.\r\n\r\nRainbowBS(RBS) is an open-source base library developed for embedded systems especially with limit resources.\r\n\r\nRBS is written by C language in compliance with the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard and it is set-up to be highly portable.Therefore it is independent of hardware architecture and can be incorporated into low cost micro-controllers like 8051,AVR,PIC,ARM and etc...,just with small porting code.\r\n\r\n### RainbowBS Features\r\n\r\n - __Hardware Features__\r\n   - Any 8/16/32 bits CPU can use it.\r\n   - One timer and very little flash and RAM needed.\r\n\r\n - __Software Features__\r\n   - __Portable__:RBS is written by C language,so it is portable on any C compiler compatible with the C99 standard .\r\n   - __Configurable__:RBS has base components and optional advanced components listed below.\r\n\r\n    |Basic Type|Basic Macros|System/CPU Info.|Memory Operation|Conversion related|\r\n    |:--------:|:----------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:----------------:|\r\n    |base      |base        |base            |base            |base              |\r\n\r\n    |Debug        |Dynamic Memory Management|Protothread Process Model|OS support|\r\n    |:-----------:|:----------------------:|:-----------------------:|:--------:|\r\n    |optional     |optional                |optional                 |optional  |\r\n\r\n   - __OS Independence__:RBS can run with or without OS support.It offers thread-safety feature for OS.\r\n   - __PC Tools__:RAutoConfig for generate configurable file by UI.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n 1. Only CPU,timer,RAM and flash are necessary in the target system.\r\n 2. The C compiler compatible with the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard(C99).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n  Designed by __QWQ__ coming from Qingdao,Shandong Prov,China.\r\n\r\n  Email: jacobqwq@icloud.com\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n  \r\n  Please refer to the RBS Manual in the project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
